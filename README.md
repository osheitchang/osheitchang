#Hi there, welcome to my personal repo ðŸ‘‹
##I am a software engineer that focuses on full-stack web and mobile development

[!NOTE]
I'm currently learning about AI to work on a couple of projects in the education industry.

I graduated from a full-stack web development bootcamp in Miami (IronHack), and I worked as a developer at City National Bank of Florida.

Currently looking to collaborate with other software engineers.
